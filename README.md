## What is it?
A nice and simple Discord bot specifically made for [AWM Malaysia Discord server](https://discord.gg/675dFG2jzs) for event purposes. It was created to randomly assign server members to one of the available factions.

## How does it work?
### Concept
A member should start the bot by sending a message `=faction` in any channel. In response to the string, an attachment and an embedded message with a reaction will be sent by the bot.
Members need to react with the same reaction that is included in the embedded message and the bot will find any of the three factions which has the least amount of members to be assigned to them.

### Method 
This bot makes use of `sort` function and `switch` statement.
